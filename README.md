# MIR - Music Information Retrieval  
Retrieve enough audio data from .mp3 files to .wav files from TV shows from 2000s until 2030s. 
Use audio files to classify the TV-shows based on their opening theme song.
Created my own database with approximately 100 shows, which showed an insignifican correlation between the opening theme song and the show genre. However, it is the start of a database to be used in further reseach about this topic.
